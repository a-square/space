- Basic idea
  - Wavelets lead to good image compression with few coefficients
  - We want to capture roughly the same amount of data samples and recover these coefficients
    - K times more to fight noise, aliasing etc
  - Sampling method
    - Generate random "mask" images (realistic or noise?), samples are correlations w/ them
  - Recovery methods
    - Matching pursuit (greedy algorithm on wavelet basis functions)
      - Faster algorithms
    - Basis pursuit (L1 regularization + simplex method)
      - More rubost wrt noise
- Pure math connections
  - Estimates on various Fourier stuff :)
