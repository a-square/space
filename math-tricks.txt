  - amplification trick
    - LHS <= RHS
    - LHS has a symmetry that RHS lacks (or vice versa)
    - apply the symmetry with a parameter and optimize the parameter
    - have a stronger inequality
    - examples
      - Cauchy-Schwarz (phase, then homogenisation)
      - depolarisation of bilinear form inequalities (linear symmetry: f -> f + cg)
      - translation invariance useful for negative results
      - tensor power of a function
        - can also delete logarithms (?)
        - useful when working with Shannon entropy (!)
