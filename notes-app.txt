Principles:
- Plain text: greppable, easy to view in any editor, including vim and friends
  - .txt files are notes
- Information not lost when syncronizing: have a merge tool
- Ships with shell scripts for CLI usage
- Have tags that are searchable
  - Mobile app may have nice things like highlighting and touch-to-search
- Mobile app to make things easy
- Very simple syncronization: you should be able to write a working backend in a day
- All files are plain text, binary files are not used even for indices
