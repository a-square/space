Dimensional analysis
- What's wrong about comparing net worth of Exxon with GDP of Nigeria?
  - GDP is turnover per year, net worth is the valuation of assets
    - One is $, the other is $/year
    - One is net, the other is gross
  - Dimension: a kind of measurable quantity
  - Unit: the amount of a dimension that we assign the number of 1 to
  - Watch out for faulty comparisons
- Application to free fall problem
  - Constraint propagation to figure out the "rough" formula
    - This amounts to finding the kernel of vectors in the dimension space (v.s. over \QQ)
    - Notation (in this book):
      - \propto - proportional up to dimensional factor
      - \sim - proportional up to dimensionless factor
      - \approx - proportional up to dimensionless factor close to 1
    - Overlooking dimensionless factors can be advantageous
    - Vertical throw problem
      - Dimensional analysis
        - g ~ L / T^2
        - v_0 ~ L / T
        - t ~ v_0 / g
      - True story
        - The answer is twice time till the ball stops
        - v' = -g, v(0) = v_0
        - v(t) = -g t + v_0, therefore v(t) = 0 iff t = v_0 / g
        - The answer is 2 v_0 / g
- Dimensional analysis in the abstract
  - Make up a consistent set of dimensions for yourself
    - This probably has to do with dilation symmetry
  - Gaussian integral
    - \int_{-\infty}^\infty e^{- \alpha x^2} dx = f(\alpha)
    - suppose x is length (dimension L)
    - the exponent is dimensionless so [\alpha] = [x]^{-2} = L^{-2}
    - the integral has the same dimensions as the Riemann sum
      - so it's L
      - therefore [f(\alpha)] = L
      - therefore f(\alpha) ~ \alpha^{-1/2}
    - change of a variable approach
      - integrand is symmetric w.r.t (x, \alpha) -> (t x, \alpha / t^2)
      - the integral diverges when \alpha <= 0, so assume \alpha > 0.
      - set \alpha = b^2
      - then \int_{-\infty}^\infty e^{- (bx)^2} dx = 1/b \int_{-\infty}^\infty e^{y^2} dy \sim 1/b
    - another problem
      - \int_0^\infty e^{- a t^3} dt = f(a)
      - [f(a)] = T, [a] = T^{-3}
        - therefore, f(a) ~ t^{-1/3}

Easy case analysis
- When given several alternatives passing the dimensional checks, use easy cases to reject the bad ones
- Use numerical methods to hone in on the coefficients
  - Only works if you have a finite number of suspects, though, or if you can bound the difference between the numerical and the true value (probably should go to Terry Tao for tricks on that end)
