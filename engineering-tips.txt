On technical debt:

- understand what the code *actually* and *genuinely* needs to be able to do today and tomorrow
- think of a way of delivering that with the available resources
- think a little about what *might* be needed in the future, acknowledging that this is only a best guess
- make sure that it is not impossible (or prohibitively expensive) to change things later
